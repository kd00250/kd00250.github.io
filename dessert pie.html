                    <h3>Instructions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>For Crust: Place crackers, 1/4 cup peanuts, and brown sugar in the bowl of a food processor and process until crushed into very fine crumbs, 
                            about 45 seconds. With processor running, pour melted butter through food chute; process until well combined, about 10 seconds. </li>
                        <li>Transfer mixture to an ungreased 9-inch pie plate; press crumbs evenly into bottom and up sides of pie plate. Freeze, uncovered, 
                            until crust is hardened, about 15 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Meanwhile, make filling: Beat cream cheese, peanut butter, and 6 tablespoons caramel sauce in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until 
                            very smooth and creamy, stopping to scrape down sides of bowl as needed, about 2 minutes. </li>
                        <li>Add powdered sugar, and beat on low speed until smooth and fluffy, about 10 seconds. Carefully fold whipped topping into cream cheese mixture in 3 additions, 
                            folding until mixture is homogeneous and well combined. Fold in the 1 1/2 cups finely chopped nougat bars until evenly distributed. </li>
                        <li>Spread remaining 2 tablespoons caramel sauce evenly over bottom of chilled crust.</li>
                        <li>Transfer filling into crust, and smooth into an even layer using a small offset spatula. Cover loosely with plastic wrap, 
                            and chill in the refrigerator until filling is completely firm, at least 4 hours or up to 24 hours.</li>
                        <li>Before serving, drizzle with chocolate syrup and caramel sauce. Sprinkle evenly with the 1/3 cup chopped nougat bars and peanuts.
                            Return to the freezer until sauce is set, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
